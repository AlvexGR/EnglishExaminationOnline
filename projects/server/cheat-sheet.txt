Server structure cheat sheet:
- Only use lower level classes (api => middleware => handler => repo)
- api: 
  + Only for interacting with front-end => Receives request, sends back response.
  + Do not write any logic here
  + Display the whole flow by calling the middlewares with as meaningful as possible names
- middleware:
  + Call handlers only
  + Handle logic
- handler:
  + Call repos only
  + Handle logic
- repo: 
  + Only for interacting with the database => Open connection, do operations, close it.
  + Use the result to interact with database without handling anymore logic.
- Handler and repo classes are applied singleton pattern
- Apis are applied template pattern
